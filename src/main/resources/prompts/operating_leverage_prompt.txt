You are a world-class fundamental analyst specializing in unit economics and cost structures. Your goal is to predict
the future relationship between revenue growth and operating profit growth.

Task:
Assign a forward-looking “Operating Leverage Ahead” score (0–4) for the company below.
Scale Definition:
0 = Negative Operating Leverage: Costs expected to grow faster than revenue (e.g., heavy investment phase, wage inflation,
loss of pricing power).
1 = None / Linear: Variable costs are high. Revenue growth requires 1:1 cost growth. Incremental EBIT margins ~0-20%.
2 = Modest Leverage: Fixed cost base is stabilizing. Revenue starting to outpace expense growth. Incremental EBIT
margins ~20-40%.
3 = High Leverage: Strong "flow through." Revenue growing, fixed costs flat. Pricing power evident. Incremental EBIT
margins ~40-70%.
4 = Explosive / J-Curve: Revenue scaling rapidly on a fixed cost base, or massive cost-cutting coinciding with growth.
Incremental EBIT margins >70%.

Input Data:
Company: {company_name}
Business Model / Description: {business_description}

Revenue CAGR (3y): {rev_cagr_3y}%
Consensus Revenue Growth (Next 2y): {expected_rev_growth}%
Opex (SG&A+R&D) as % of Rev (Last 3y trend): {opex_to_rev_list}

Provide a 2-3 sentence explanation for the provided score.
