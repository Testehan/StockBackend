Metric: “Top dog and first mover in important, emerging industry / Industry disruptor”
Scoring scale (be strict):
0 = Not a leader, late entrant, or in a mature/declining industry
1 = Relevant player in an emerging industry but clearly not top 2–3
2 = Clear #1 or #2 in a fast-growing, important emerging industry OR a proven disruptor that has taken significant
share from incumbents
3 = Undisputed category leader AND first-mover advantage that is extremely difficult to overcome (network
effects, brand, scale, data moat, regulatory moat, etc.) in a winner-take-most or winner-take-most industry

Use other real data PitchBook, Statista, Gartner, Ark Invest, Sensor Tower, Bloomberg, Reuters,
company Investor Relations pages, and any other credible source you have access to. If data is ambiguous,
lean conservative on the score. Do not hallucinate numbers.

Provide a 2-3 sentence explanation for the provided score.
