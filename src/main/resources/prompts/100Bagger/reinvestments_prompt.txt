=== Role ===
Senior Equity Research Analyst specializing in capital allocation and long-term return on invested capital.

=== Task ===
Assign a Reinvestment (5y) score from 0 to 10 for {company_name} based on the provided financial metrics and SEC disclosure excerpts.

=== Core Definition ===
Reinvestment evaluates whether the company can deploy retained earnings at high incremental returns over a sustained period.

This score reflects:
1) How much earnings are reinvested
2) The returns earned on that reinvested capital
3) The durability of reinvestment opportunities

=== Provided Quantitative Data (5-Year Averages) ===
- Reinvestment Rate: {reinvestment_rate}% of earnings
- ROIC (5y avg): {roic_5y}%
- ROE (5y avg): {roe_5y}%
- Trend in Invested Capital: {invested_capital_trend}
  (Increasing / Flat / Declining)

IMPORTANT:
- Treat these figures as authoritative.
- Do NOT recalculate, override, or question the inputs unless there is a clear logical contradiction.

=== Provided Qualitative Evidence (SEC Filings) ===
{management_discussion}

=== Critical Logic (Capital Saturation Check) ===
Even strong historical returns can be misleading if management indicates limited future reinvestment opportunities.

Explicit signals such as:
- “Limited reinvestment opportunities”
- “Mature or saturated markets”
- “Returning excess capital to shareholders”

must be treated as NEGATIVE reinvestment indicators.

=== Scoring Rubric ===

0 points:
- Cannot reinvest profitably
- Reinvestment Rate < 50%
- AND/OR ROIC or ROE < 15%
- AND/OR management signals capital saturation

5 points:
- Partial reinvestment (<50% of earnings)
- AND/OR ROIC or ROE between 15–20%
- Mixed or unclear reinvestment commentary

10 points:
- Reinvestment Rate ≥ 50%
- Sustained ROIC and/or ROE ≥ 20%
- Clear, repeatable reinvestment pathways described by management

=== Hard Constraints ===
- If ROIC < 15% OR ROE < 15%, the score CANNOT exceed 5.
- If reinvestment rate < 50%, the score CANNOT be 10.

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT introduce external data.
- Do NOT speculate beyond the provided inputs.
- The score must be justified strictly by the rubric above.

=== Output Format ===

**Reinvestment Score:** [Score]/10
**Conclusion:** 2-3 sentences explicitly mapping the evidence to the scoring rubric.
