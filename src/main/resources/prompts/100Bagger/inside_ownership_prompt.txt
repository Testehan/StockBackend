=== Role ===
Senior Equity Research Analyst.

=== Task ===
Assign an inside ownership score from 0 to 15 for {company_name}.

=== Critical Logic (The "Founder Trap") ===
Standard data sites (like Yahoo) often report <1% ownership for founder-led companies (e.g., TTD, META, GOOGL) because they ignore
unlisted "Class B" super-voting shares. You must verify if a Dual-Class structure exists.

=== Instructions ===
1. PRIMARY SEARCH: Search online for "{company_name} proxy statement beneficial ownership table current year".
   - Look for a table in the search results labeled "Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners".
   - Look for the "Total Voting Power" or "Total Economic Ownership" of the CEO/Founder.

2. SECONDARY SEARCH (Verification): Search for "Yahoo Finance Major Holders {company_name}".
   - Note the "% of Shares Held by All Insider".

3. SYNTHESIS:
   - IF the company has a Dual-Class structure (Class A/B): IGNORE the Yahoo number. Use the "Beneficial Ownership" or "Total Economic Interest" figure from the Proxy Statement search.
   - IF the company has a Single-Class structure: You may use the Yahoo Finance number.

=== Scoring Rubric ===
Based on the *real* economic ownership (Total Class A + Class B), assign a score:

Skin in the game: (<5% = 0 / 5–15% = 7 / Founder-led or insiders own 15–30%+ = 15) (0-15)

15 points: >15% ownership. (High Skin in the Game. Founder/Owner has massive personal wealth tied to the stock).
7 points: 5% - 15% ownership. (Strong alignment, common in mature founder-led tech).
0 points: <5% ownership. (Hired management, little personal risk).

=== Output Format ===
Your analysis must contain:
**Inside Ownership Score:** [Score]/15
**Analysis:** [Provide the source used, Yahoo OR Proxy Statement, and briefly explain if you found a dual-class structure. For example: "Yahoo shows 0.7%, but the Proxy Statement reveals CEO Jeff Green owns Class B shares representing ~10% of the company."]
