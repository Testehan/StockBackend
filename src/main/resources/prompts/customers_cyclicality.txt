Role: Senior Equity Research Analyst.

Task: Assign a final Cyclicality Score from 0 to 5 to {company_name} where
0–1 = Highly cyclical
2–3 = Moderately cyclical
4–5 = Recession-resistant / defensive
(Higher score = more recession-proof)

You must stay strictly within 0–5. Use only the data provided.

Constraint: We only have recent financial data. You must rely heavily on the Industry Classification, Business Model
Analysis (from text), and Margin Volatility (from data) to infer how this stock would perform in a deep recession.

Input Data:
Company Profile:
    Industry/Sector: {company_industry}
    Beta: {company_beta}
Financial Stability (Last Available Years):
    Revenue Trend (from oldest to recent starting with oldest): {company_revenue_trend}
    Operating Margin Trend (from oldest to recent starting with oldest): {company_operating_margin_trend}
Business Model Insights (from SEC Filings):
    Business Description: {business_description}
    Risk Factors: {risk_factors}

Analysis Instructions:
Step 1 : Industry Baseline (choose only one)
    Semiconductors, Autos, Luxury, Airlines, Hotels, Oil & Gas E&P, Metals & Mining, Construction, Banks, Capital Goods → 0–1
    Software/SaaS, Food & Beverage, Pharma, Utilities, Telecom, Discount Retailers, Waste, Insurance → 4–5
    Everything else → 2–3

Step 2: Margin Volatility Check
    If operating margins stayed inside a ±5 pp band across all years shown → +1.5 to +2 added to score
    If ±5–12 pp band → +0.5 added to score
    If >12 pp swing or revenue collapsed in any year 0 added to score

3. Business-Model Modifier (add or subtract max ±1.0 total from the running total)
   Strong recurring/contractual/regulatory revenue (>60 %), or must-have product → +0.8 to +1.0
   Visible pricing power repeatedly mentioned → +0.5
   High operating leverage, heavy capex, commodity exposure, discretionary demand, or concentrated cyclical
   customers → –0.8 to –1.0

Final score = Industry baseline + Margin Volatility Check + Business-model modifier
→ Round to nearest 0.5 and clamp between 0 and 5.

Assign a Score from 0 to 5 based on this logic:
A higher score means more recession-proof, not more cyclical:
0–1: Highly cyclical. Demand collapses in downturns; margins volatile; high operating leverage; industry is recession-sensitive.
2–3: Moderately cyclical. Mixed signals: some defensive attributes but meaningful economic exposure.
4–5: Recession-resistant / stable. Defensive industry, resilient margins, predictable demand, or strong recurring revenue.
Score must be consistent with all three pillars.

Output Requirement:
1. Provide the Score (0-5).
2. Explanation of the score : write 1 sentence explanation about each of the 3 pillars of analysis.
