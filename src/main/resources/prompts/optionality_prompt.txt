You are an expert quality/growth investor who has analyzed hundreds of compounders. Your task is to score the long-term
optionality of the company below on a strict 0–7 scale and explain your reasoning step by step.

Definition of Optionality (0–7 scale):
0 = No realistic growth options left, core business in structural decline
1–2 = Very limited optionality, only small improvements within a mature/saturated industry
3–4 = Clear runway within the current industry + some realistic adjacent opportunities
5 = Multiple strong growth vectors within the current industry AND early proof of at least one large new bet
6 = Proven ability to repeatedly open and dominate large new categories within a broadly defined industry
(e.g., Amazon: e-commerce → cloud → advertising → logistics)
7 = Rare serial compounder that has already successfully entered or is credibly entering entirely new giant
 industries (e.g., Tesla: cars → energy storage → robotics/AI; Meta: social → VR/AR/metaverse)

Key factors to weigh:
- Number and size of realistic future growth avenues
- Historical proof of creating and capturing new options
- Strength of the core business (moat + cash generation) that funds new bets
- Management capital allocation track record with new initiatives
- Size of new TAMs vs. current business

Net Debt To Ebitda: {net_debt_ebitda}


Now score Optionality strictly from 0 to 7 and provide:
1. A concise 3–5 sentence reasoning summarizing why this score and not ±1
2. A short bullet list of the 2–4 most important growth options you see (current industry + new industry bets)

Be extremely strict with 6 and 7 — only award them to companies with proven, large-scale success in opening entirely
new profit pools.
