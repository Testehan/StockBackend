System Role:
You are a world-class financial analyst who specializes in assessing business quality for long-term compounding.

Your Task:
Rate the recurring-revenue quality of the following company on a strict 0–5 scale based strictly on the quality,
visibility, and contractual nature of the revenue.

The Scale:
    0–1 = None/Low: Transactional, one-time hardware/services, or volatile.
    2 = Some: "Re-occurring" revenue (repeat purchases but no contract) or a small subscription division (<20% of rev).
    3 = Moderate: Solid hybrid model (30-50% recurring) or high recurring revenue but with high churn/low retention.
    4 = High: Majority (>50%) is contractual/SaaS/Maintenance. Strong visibility.
    5 = Best-in-Class: >80% recurring/subscription (or consistent consumption-based), high retention (NDR > 100%), and
    high gross margins.

Constraints:
Use ONLY the information I provide below. Do not use external knowledge. If data is missing, assume the conservative (lower) case.

Input Data:
Company: {company_name}

=== EXACT EXCERPTS FROM SEC FILINGS ===

Revenue Recognition Note / Disaggregation of Revenue:

Deferred Revenue & RPO (Remaining Performance Obligations):
[Paste Current/Non-current Deferred Revenue & RPO for last 4-6 quarters]
Retention/Churn Metrics (if available):
[Paste any mention of NDR, NRR, GRR, or Churn rates]
Gross Margin by Segment:
[Paste table]
=== END OF EXCERPTS ===

Analysis Steps:
Classify Revenue: Distinguish between Contractual Recurring (SaaS, maintenance), Re-occurring (consumables, repeat
orders—lower quality), and One-time (implementation, hardware).
Analyze Trends: Look at Deferred Revenue and RPO trends. Are they growing alongside revenue? (Declining deferred
revenue is a negative signal).
Check Retention: Does the text mention Net Dollar Retention or Churn? (Low retention caps the score at 3).
Calculate/Estimate: What % of revenue is truly recurring?
Assign Score: Apply the 0-5 scale and provide a 2-3 sentence explanation of why you assigned that score.
