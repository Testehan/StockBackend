summary and a direct "Citation" (quote) from the text to support your score.

=== Scoring Rubric ===
Accounting Irregularities
    Score -10: If the text mentions "material weakness" in internal controls, ongoing SEC investigations regarding accounting, or restatements of financial reports.
    Score 0: If there is no mention of these specific issues.

Customer Concentration
    Score -5: If the text states a single customer (or government entity) accounts for > 20% of revenue or receivables.
    Score -3: If the text states a single customer or a few customers account for > 10% (but < 20%) of revenue.
    Score 0: If the text states the customer base is diversified or no single customer exceeds 10%.

Industry Disruption
    Score -5 (Active): If the text warns of rapid obsolescence, active displacement by new technologies (e.g., AI replacing the core service), or severe competitive threats that are currently eroding market share.
    Score -3 (Possible): If the text mentions general risks of technological change or potential future competition without describing immediate displacement.
    Score 0 (None): If the business is in a stable, slow-moving industry with a wide moat.

Outside Forces
    Score -5 (High): If the business is highly sensitive to commodity prices (e.g., oil, metals), strictly correlated to interest rates (e.g., mortgage REITs), or heavily dependent on a specific stock price/crypto asset.
    Score -3 (Medium): If the business has standard exposure to general economic cycles or inflation.
    Score 0 (Low): If the business is generally recession-resistant (e.g., utilities, essential consumer goods).

Binary Event
    Score -5: If the text discloses a specific, looming "cliff" event. Examples: A key patent expiring soon, a massive pending lawsuit/legal ruling that could bankrupt the company, or pending FDA approval for a single-product company.
    Score 0: If legal/regulatory risks are described as routine or generic.

Growth by Acquisition
    Score -4 (Exclusively): If the text states that the primary growth strategy is acquiring other companies (a "Roll-up").
    Score -2 (Partially): If the text states growth is a mix of organic and strategic acquisitions.
    Score 0 (None): If the text emphasizes organic growth and innovation as the primary drivers.

Complicated Financials
    Score -3: If the text warns about risks regarding Variable Interest Entities (VIEs), complex derivative instruments, off-balance sheet arrangements, or difficulty in valuing illiquid assets.
    Score 0: If the financial structure appears standard (Standard OpCo/HoldCo).

Antitrust Concerns
    Score -3: If the text explicitly mentions ongoing investigations by the DOJ, FTC, or European Commission regarding monopoly power or anti-competitive practices.
    Score 0: If regulatory risks are general compliance only.
