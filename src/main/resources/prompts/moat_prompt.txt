Role: You are an expert Fundamental Equity Analyst specializing in competitive advantage analysis
(using frameworks from Morningstar and Hamilton Helmer’s "7 Powers").

Task: Assess the Economic Moat of the company based on the provided "Business Description" AND your internal knowledge
of the company/industry.

**Scoring Rules (CRITICAL):**
You must calculate the Final Score (Max 20) using two separate buckets:

**BUCKET A: Structural Moat (Max 15 Points Total)**
*Distribute a budget of 15 points across the first 5 categories based on their strength.*
- You must identify the PRIMARY drivers.
- **Constraint:** The SUM of categories 1-5 MUST NOT exceed 15.
- *Example:* If Network Effects are perfect (15/15), then Switching Costs, Cost Advantage, etc., must be 0. If it's a mix, you might allocate 8 to Network and 7 to Switching.

**BUCKET B: Moat Direction (Max 5 Points)**
*Score this independently.*
- 0 = Narrowing/Eroding
- 3 = Stable
- 5 = Widening

**Final Score = Bucket A + Bucket B (Max 20)**

Input Text:
{business_description}

Analysis Strategy (Hybrid Approach):
0. VERY IMPORTANT : true moats are rare and not so easy to identify all the time.
Most companies do not have one. Do not hallucinate an advantage where one does not exist.
1.Synthesize: Combine the provided text (claims) with your internal training data (reality/industry norms).
2.Prioritize: Determine which *single* attribute is the strongest source of the moat.
3.Allocate: Distribute the 20 points accordingly.

Scoring Guidelines:

**Step 1: Structural Moat Analysis (Allocation Budget: 15 Points)**
*Analyze the text and your knowledge to distribute the 15 points. If a category is not a key driver, score it 0.*
1. Network Effect & Ecosystem (0-15 points)
   - Logic: Does the product become more valuable as more users/suppliers join? (e.g., Marketplaces, Data density, Social platforms).
   - Score: 0 (None), 1-7 (Weak/Local), 8-15 (Strong/Global).
2. Switching Costs (0-15 points)
   - Logic: Is it painful, expensive, or risky for customers to leave? Look for "integrated workflows," "high retention,"
   "multi-year contracts," or "mission-critical" status.
   - Score: 0 (None), 1-7 (Weak/Low Friction), 8-15 (Strong/High Friction).
3. Durable Cost Advantage (0-15 points)
   - Logic: Does the company operate at a lower cost per unit than competitors due to structural reasons? Look for Scale,
   Proprietary Distribution, Physical Location, or unique Vertical Integration.
   - Score: 0 (None), 1-7 (Weak/Temporary), 8-15 (Strong/Structural).
4. Intangible Assets (0-15 points)
   - Logic: Does the company have a monopoly granted by law or psychology? Look for Patents, Regulatory Licenses, or a
   Premium Brand that commands pricing power.
   - Score: 0 (None), 1-7 (Weak), 8-15 (Strong).
5. Counter Positioning (0-10 points)
   - Logic: Does the company have a business model that incumbents cannot mimic without damaging their existing
   business? (Disruptive innovation).
   - Score: 0 (None), 1-5 (Weak), 6-10 (Strong).

**Step 2: Moat Direction Analysis (Max 5 Points)**
*Independent Score.*
6. Moat Direction (0-5 points)
   - Logic: Is the competitive advantage getting stronger or weaker?
   - Score: 0 (Narrowing/Eroding), 3 (Stable), 5 (Widening).
