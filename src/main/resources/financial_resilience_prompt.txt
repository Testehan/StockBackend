Act as a strict financial credit analyst. I need you to calculate the "Financial Resilience" score (0-5) for a company based on the data provided below.

Here is the financial data:
- Total Cash & Short Term Investments: {totalCashAndEquivalents}
- Total Debt (Long + Short Term): {totalDebt}
- EBITDA (TTM): {ttmEbitda}
- Interest Expense (TTM): [Insert Value]

Instructions for Scoring:
1. Calculate "Net Debt" (Total Debt minus Total Cash).
2. Calculate "Net Debt to EBITDA" Ratio.
3. Calculate "Interest Coverage" Ratio (EBITDA divided by Interest Expense).

Assign a Score from 0 to 5 based on this logic:
- Score 0 (Fragile): Negative EBITDA OR Interest Coverage < 1.5x.
- Score 1 (Weak): Net Debt/EBITDA > 4x OR Interest Coverage < 3x.
- Score 2-3 (Average): Net Debt/EBITDA is between 2x and 4x.
- Score 4 (Strong): Net Debt/EBITDA is between 0x and 2x.
- Score 5 (Citadel): Company has "Negative Net Debt" (More Cash than Debt) OR Net Debt/EBITDA < 1x with massive Interest Coverage (>15x).

Output Requirement:
1. Provide the Score (0-5).
2. In the message show the calculated Ratios. Write 1-2 sentences explaining why you gave this score.
